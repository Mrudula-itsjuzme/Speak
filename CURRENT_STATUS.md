# 🎯 Current Status Summary

## ✅ What's Working

### OpenRouter Integration - FULLY WORKING
- ✅ API key configured and tested
- ✅ Successfully generating prompts with GPT-4o-mini
- ✅ All 3 API routes updated:
  - `/api/prompt` - Generates language tutor system prompts
  - `/api/summary` - Creates session summaries  
  - `/api/translate-ui` - Translates UI strings
- ✅ Automatic model fallback working
- ✅ Rate limit handling working

**Evidence:**
```
✅ Success with model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
POST /api/prompt 200 in 13668ms
GET /learn?lang=japanese&personality=energetic 200
```

## ❓ What Needs Investigation

### Voice Conversation - NOT RESPONDING

**The Issue:**
- You can connect to ElevenLabs (button shows "Connected")
- When you speak, you don't get a response from the AI

**Why This Happens:**
Your app uses **two separate AI systems**:

1. **OpenRouter** (✅ Working) - Generates the initial prompt/instructions
2. **ElevenLabs** (❓ Issue) - Handles the actual voice conversation

The problem is with #2 - the ElevenLabs agent.

## 🔍 Next Steps to Debug

### Step 1: Test the Diagnostic Page

I just created a diagnostic tool. Open it:

```
http://localhost:3000/diagnostic
```

This will show you:
- ✅ Connection status
- 📨 All messages sent/received
- ❌ Any errors from ElevenLabs
- 🔍 Detailed event logs

### Step 2: Check ElevenLabs Dashboard

The most likely issue is that your ElevenLabs agent isn't configured:

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find your agent (check the ID in your `.env.local`)
3. Click on it to edit
4. Check these things:
   - ✅ Is it "Published" (not Draft)?
   - ✅ Does it have a "System Prompt" configured?
   - ✅ Can you test it directly on the ElevenLabs website?

### Step 3: Test Agent Directly

On the ElevenLabs dashboard:
1. Click your agent
2. Click "Test" or "Try it"
3. Speak to it
4. **Does it respond?**
   - If YES → Agent works, issue is integration
   - If NO → Agent needs configuration

## 🛠️ Likely Solutions

### Solution 1: Configure ElevenLabs Agent (Most Likely)

Your ElevenLabs agent probably needs a system prompt. Add this to your agent on the ElevenLabs dashboard:

```
You are a friendly and encouraging language tutor.
Your role is to help users learn new languages through conversation.

Instructions:
- Speak primarily in the target language
- Keep responses concise (1-3 sentences)
- Correct mistakes gently
- Ask engaging questions
- Be patient and supportive
- Provide brief translations when needed
```

### Solution 2: Check Agent ID

Make sure your `.env.local` has the correct agent ID:

```bash
# Run this to check:
node verify_env.js
```

Should show:
```
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID set: YES
```

### Solution 3: Verify Microphone

The browser error you mentioned (`runtime.lastError`) is usually a browser extension issue, but let's also verify your microphone works:

1. Go to: https://www.onlinemictest.com/
2. Allow microphone access
3. Speak - bars should move
4. If not, check browser permissions

**The problem is at step 6** - ElevenLabs connection.

## 🎯 What to Do Right Now

1. **Open the diagnostic page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/diagnostic
   ```

2. **Click "Start Connection"** and watch the logs

3. **Try speaking** and see what happens

4. **Share the logs with me** - copy/paste what you see

5. **Check ElevenLabs dashboard:**
   - https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
   - Is your agent configured?
   - Can you test it there?
